                    <h3>Terms & Conditions
                    </h3>
                    <p>All debt solutions should be very carefully considered. We never charge for the service we give you, but if you enter into a financial solution for example an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) or Debt Management Plan with one of our trusted partners, then fees will apply and these are clearly explained to you by one of our trusted partners advisors or in the documentation you will receive. moneyassist.uk partners are regulated by the Insolvency Service. They apply the principles of business and you have the right to a cooling off period of 14 days. It is likely that your ability to obtain credit will be affected for a minimum of 6 years, even if the solution lasts for less. </p>
                    <p>At moneyassist.uk we do not provide any advice. On completion of our form, we will introduce you to one of our authorised debt solutions partners. We use the contact details you have given us on the form to make this introduction. A debt advisor will contact you by telephone. During that telephone call, the debt advisor will discuss your options in more detail. During this call, and other subsequent communications, you will be dealing with a debt solutions partner and not moneyassist.uk. All solutions are subject to acceptance and eligibility. Further conditions will apply and calls are recorded for your protection. Initial advice is always free but, as commercial companies our partners do charge for on-going services. Debt Write off only applies on completion of the Insolvency Solution and details do appear on a public register. Full details will be discussed prior to entering into an agreement and alternative options may be offered, where considered to be in your best interest. Your ability to obtain credit will be affected for a minimum of 6 years, even if the solution lasts for less and your assets and property could be at risk. </p>
                    <p>By submitting the enquiry form you agree that the information provided is true and accurate and that moneyassist.uk may send the details of this enquiry to an appropriate trusted partner for the purpose of furthering your enquiry and that the trusted partner may contact you for further information as required. We will not send, sell, loan or lease your data to any other third party except those needed to provide the service you have requested. </p>
                    <p>We work exclusively with our trusted debt solution providers. If you proceed with one of their solution options, we may receive a fee for introducing you to them. </p>
                    <p>You can request details of these fees, by emailing us at contact@moneyassist.uk. We will then provide you with the precise amount of the fee or, where that amount is not known, the likely amount. </p>
                    <p>*90% of customer enquiries meet the minimum requirements of one of our Debt Solution Providers.
