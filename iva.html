                        <p>An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a legally binding arrangement made between you and your creditors to pay off your debts with a repayment plan that suits your circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Since it is a formal and legal debt solution;you,as well as your creditors,are obliged to maintain the agreement. Once you enter into an IVA your creditors are unable to take any further action against you.</p>
                        <p>During the course of your plan all interest and fees associated with your debts are frozen. At the end of the IVA the remaining debts are written off.</p>

                        <p>Before applying for any debt solution,(including IVA) in the UK,it is important you discuss your situation to make sure you are aware of all your options.</p>
                        <p>An IP will begin the process by working out what you can afford to repay and how long the IVA lasts. You’ll have to give details about your financial situation,e.g. your assets,debts,income and creditors.</p>
                        <p>If an IVA is right for you,you will work out a repayment plan with an IP. Your IP will draft an IVA proposal with you which details your repayment offer,any assets,and all of your unsecured creditors.</p>
                        <p>Your insolvency practitioner will contact your creditors and your IVA proposal is then presented to creditors in a meeting. The IVA will be approved if the creditors holding 75% of your debts agree to it. It will bind all your creditors,even those who disagreed with it.</p>
                        <p>An IVA will stop your creditors from taking any form of legal action against you for your debts.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>In the UK,only residents of England,Northern Ireland or Wales can apply for an IVA. If you live in Scotland,check out Trust Deeds instead</em></strong></p>

                        <p>An IVA would cover most of your unsecured debts. Debts covered by IVA include:</p>

                            <li>You do not need to give up ownership of your home. The IVA will provide protection for your assets.</li>

                            <li>You make only a single payment each month,which is distributed to creditors on your behalf.</li>

                        <p>To set up an IVA,you need to instruct the services of an IP so there are some costs involved. An IP is a licensed professional (usually a lawyer or an accountant).</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Disbursements </strong></p>
                        <p>Disbursements usually cover expenses paid to third party companies for software licenses,insurances,or any regulation that is required. They could also include the cost of additional services hired to offer the best returns to creditors.</p>
                        <p>An IVA usually lasts for five or six years. However,in some cases,it can be extended by another 12 months to give borrowers a chance to repay their debt according to the agreed terms.</p>

                    <h3>Terms & Conditions
                    </h3>
                    <p>All debt solutions should be very carefully considered. We never charge for the service we give you, but if you enter into a financial solution for example an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) or Debt Management Plan with one of our trusted partners, then fees will apply and these are clearly explained to you by one of our trusted partners advisors or in the documentation you will receive. moneyassist.uk partners are regulated by the Insolvency Service. They apply the principles of business and you have the right to a cooling off period of 14 days. It is likely that your ability to obtain credit will be affected for a minimum of 6 years, even if the solution lasts for less. </p>
                    <p>At moneyassist.uk we do not provide any advice. On completion of our form, we will introduce you to one of our authorised debt solutions partners. We use the contact details you have given us on the form to make this introduction. A debt advisor will contact you by telephone. During that telephone call, the debt advisor will discuss your options in more detail. During this call, and other subsequent communications, you will be dealing with a debt solutions partner and not moneyassist.uk. All solutions are subject to acceptance and eligibility. Further conditions will apply and calls are recorded for your protection. Initial advice is always free but, as commercial companies our partners do charge for on-going services. Debt Write off only applies on completion of the Insolvency Solution and details do appear on a public register. Full details will be discussed prior to entering into an agreement and alternative options may be offered, where considered to be in your best interest. Your ability to obtain credit will be affected for a minimum of 6 years, even if the solution lasts for less and your assets and property could be at risk. </p>
                    <p>By submitting the enquiry form you agree that the information provided is true and accurate and that moneyassist.uk may send the details of this enquiry to an appropriate trusted partner for the purpose of furthering your enquiry and that the trusted partner may contact you for further information as required. We will not send, sell, loan or lease your data to any other third party except those needed to provide the service you have requested. </p>
                    <p>We work exclusively with our trusted debt solution providers. If you proceed with one of their solution options, we may receive a fee for introducing you to them. </p>
                    <p>You can request details of these fees, by emailing us at contact@moneyassist.uk. We will then provide you with the precise amount of the fee or, where that amount is not known, the likely amount. </p>
